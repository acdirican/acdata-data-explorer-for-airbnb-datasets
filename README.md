# Data Explorer for Airbnb Datasets

The Data Explorer allows you to open, search,- and filter an Airbnb dataset. You can also observ some statistics and charts about the active data and even save it.

You can also open data sets directly from an internet sources by using its URL.

The projects was fully coded in Java using Swing, Java collections and conventional loops. In this version, I did not use Java Stream and Functinao Interfaces on purpose. I am going to develope another version of the same software coded using Java Stream and JavaFX later.

I desinged the softwareby  appliying modern Software Engineering an Object Oriented Design principles. You will find a well-defined software structure in which its parts have been properly seperated, including GUI, model, data.

Whil principle such as Abtraction, Encapsulation, Information Hiding, Low Coupling and High Cohesion, vairous design pattern were applied to obtaind a sound and flexiple code.

I used Facades in packages gui, dataset dataviewer adn chart. These also comply with the Facgtory design pattern. Moreover, for the implementatipn of filtering mechanisms in dataset package, I applied DEceorator design pattern. Please inspect the clas diagram below and the screen outs of the software.
